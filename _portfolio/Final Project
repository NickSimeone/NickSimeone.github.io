## Introduction/Background 
For my final project I have decided to research the variability in impact between bars and breweries on the demographics of the city of Portland, Maine. Boasting the highest brewery per capita rate, Portland was a perfect location to study the characteristics of individuals who reside near these breweries versus those who live near bars. My interest regarding this topic was to see if there is a notable correlation between bars/breweries and demographics. I believe there is a stereotype that breweries attract wealthier older generations while younger, poorer crowds migrate to bars, and I wanted to test this theory by creating visualizations of the spatial patterns of demographics and bar/brewery locations. I ultimately compared education, age, and income in specific tracts located in Portland and saw how these related to the bars/breweries in the area.

## Data/Methods
I began by pulling demographic ASC data from the 2021 census in the tracts of Portland, Maine by using the get_acs() call in Rstudio. I then created a csv file of all bar and brewery locations and read this into R as well to create a multipoint shapefile, all this data was collected using my own research. Once I had all my data complied in R and all my spatial specifics whittled down to the correct tracts I wanted, I turned all my data into shapefiles that I could bring into Q. Having a shapefile for each of the three demographics I chose to study, I used color symbology on an equal interval scheme and created maps for all 3. Overlaying these maps, I used point data for each of the bars/breweries and colored them to allow for differentiation. I used proper map elements in accordance with my maps in my layout to create a credible representation of the data that we are going to visualize. 

## Analysis/Results
After compiling all my maps and interpreting the visual aspect of each one, there can be slight correlations attributed to each one regarding the demographic being studied. Looking at the bachelor’s degree maps, it can be seen that there is a high volume of bars centered in a tract with one of the lowest counts of degrees, insinuating that this is an area of overall lower education and is also correlated with a high volume of bars. In a tract in which there is a higher volume of breweries, it can also be seen that there are more bachelor’s degrees that are also associated. The tract with the most bachelor’s degrees is bordering the waterline of Portland and is scattered with both lots of breweries and bars, creating an inconclusive trend. Looking at the Median age map, there is a very clear correlation between younger age and bars, as well as a strong correlation between breweries and 30-year-olds. There seems to be a clear draw for people in their early 20s to reside in areas in close proximity to bars. As far as the median household income is concerned, there was less of a correlation than the other two demographics. There was a slight indication that richer areas did all in all have more breweries than bars but it’s not a specifically clear relationship.

## Conclusion
After reviewing my data and map analysis, I have determined that there indeed a light correlation between bars/breweries and demographics. There was a spatial relevance between bars and a younger, poorer, less educated crowd versus breweries and an older, richer, more educated crowd. This result is something I anticipated as breweries are often stigmatized as a more gaudy, upper-class hang out area whereas bars are often seen as a place to drink a less quality beverage. Even though bars can range between dive-esque quality and classy, breweries are more consistent in the fact that they are all considered higher class. The drinks are usually more expensive, and the atmosphere usually does not become as rowdy, which is often an attractive quality for older rich crowds. My work is only a micro display of the brewery vs bar debate, there are many other locations in which there can be data visualized. This focus was primarily on an urban location and may create different conclusions in suburban and rural locations. All in all, I believe this is a foot in the door regarding the relationship between preferred drinking locations and demographics.

## Reflection
If I were to build off of my work, I would have liked to visualize more demographic qualities such as age along with the other things I looked at. There is a stereotype that women are not as fond as beer, which is a brewery-focused product, and I would like to determine if this in indeed true or not by seeing if there are more men than women at breweries. Another thing I would like to do differently is to conduct my research on a bigger scale and work with bar/brewery totals rather than individual locations. Some of the specific tracts that I was interpreting had an equal split of bars and breweries, which made it difficult to create a real distinction to see if the specific demographic trait associated with this area. As far as the course goes, I feel like I have learned a lot of coding as well as how to apply this to a new software that I had never touched prior. I have become well versed in the understanding of R-studio and how to use it to my advantage from a data as well as a visualization aspect. Being able to link R and QGIS is a paired skill that allows for complete geospatial mastery.
