### Introduction

I made a web map using QGIS and Leaflet. This webmap is a controllable interface the allows you to discover NFL stadiums and which Super Bowls were hosted within them. Overlaying the point layer is a graduated colors layer that symoblizes which states hosted the most games, Florida is in the lead with 18!

### Data

I compiled all the data by locating super bowl statistics provided by ESPN and matched the super bowl host locations with their proper coordinates. I put all this data into a CSV table and brought it into QGIS to be able to create my webmap.
