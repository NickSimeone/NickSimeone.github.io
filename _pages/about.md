Hello, my name is Nick Simeone and I am currently an Undergraduate of Environmental Science and Geography at UMBC. I am also an Undergraduate Research Assistant at CUERE where I specialize in GIS. Throughout my academic career, I have gained proficiency in various software tools such as ArcGIS Pro, Qgis, Python, ENVI, and Rstudio.

My long-term goal is to pursue my Masters degree at UMBC and continue my research in GIS. Specifically, I plan to focus on GIS in relation to urban hydrology over the next two years. I am passionate about the application of GIS in environmental science, and I believe that exploring the intersection of GIS and urban hydrology has the potential to create positive changes in our urban communities.

In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and camping, as well as exploring new places to eat and drink with friends. I am always eager to learn new skills and take on new challenges, and I am excited to see where my academic and professional journey will take me.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out.
