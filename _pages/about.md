### School
As an undergraduate student majoring in Geography and Environmental Systems, I have always had a strong passion for understanding the world we live in and using geospatial technologies to solve complex problems. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked hard and achieved a GPA of 3.566/4, as well as completing a GIScience Certificate Program with a perfect GPA of 4.0.

My coursework has provided me with a solid foundation in the fundamentals of geography and environmental systems, while also providing advanced knowledge in remote sensing, thematic cartography, and exploring the environment from a geospatial perspective. This has helped me to develop a strong understanding of the subject matter and become well-equipped to handle any challenges that come my way.

### Work
In addition to my academic achievements, I have gained valuable work experience in various positions. As a GIS Technician Intern at CUERE, I was able to take on a complex GIS project and develop animations for hydrologists. This experience helped me to foster my independence and develop workflows that were later used as templates. As a GIS Lab Proctor/Tutor, I was able to mentor students and assist professors, which helped me to further solidify my understanding of GIS technology and my ability to facilitate learning. Additionally, my time as a National Park Service GIS Intern provided me with a strong understanding of spatial data collection and analysis, as well as the ability to develop an app displaying collected data. My experience as a Server/Bartender at Big Truck Farm Brewery has allowed me to hone my customer service skills and establish a persistent and reliable work culture.

Throughout my academic and professional endeavors, I have developed strong interpersonal skills, including leadership in a team setting and excellent communication and social skills. My proficiency in software such as ArcGIS Pro, Rstudio, QGIS, Python, ENVI, and Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) has equipped me with the technical expertise required for success in the field.

### Summary 

Overall, my passion for geography and environmental systems, combined with my academic achievements, work experience, and technical expertise, make me a promising candidate for a career in GIS and related fields.
